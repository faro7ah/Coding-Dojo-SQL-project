# Coding-Dojo-SQL-project


## Introduction:

This data provided by [The yellow and green taxi trip records](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

In this project, we will apply what we've applied on advanced SQL lessons with AWS using **BlazingSql Jupyter**. We collected information from the dataset, we answered questions about Yellow Taxi Trip Records. Moreover, we visualized diversifying chart types.

# project Tools:
•``BlazingSql``: [BlazingSQL](https://docs.blazingdb.com/docs/blazingsql)is a SQL interface for cuDF, with various features to support large scale data science workflows and enterprise datasets.


•``S3 bucket``: We connect to [S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v=_I14_sXHO8U&feature=emb_title) bucket , and creat taxi table from it.

•``matplotlib``: [Visualization tool.](https://matplotlib.org/)
