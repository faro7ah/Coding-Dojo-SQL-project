# Coding-Dojo-SQL-project


## Introduction:

In this project, we will apply what we've learned on valuable Shiny Dashboard lessons with **R**. We built an interactive dashboard to convey our message in a professional method and attract the audience's attention. We used Covid19 data of North America and all countries all over the world to discover the percentage of Recovery, Deaths, Confirmed cases.
